# Simple Expense Tracker (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly Python terminal app that helps you track your expenses by saving item names and prices to a local file. It also totals your spending and displays it when requested.

## Features

- Save data to a text file (`expenses.txt`)
- View the total amount you've spent
- Simple, menu-based interface

## How to Use

   ```
   python expense_tracker.py
   ```

2. Choose an option:
   - `1`: Add a new expense
   - `2`: View total spending
   - `3`: Exit the program

3. All expenses are saved in `expenses.txt`.

## Example
